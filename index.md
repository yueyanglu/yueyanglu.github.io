### Education
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies](https://www.coaps.fsu.edu/), Florida State University. I completed my Ph.D. in Meteorology & Physical Oceanography at the [Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science](https://www.rsmas.miami.edu/), University of Miami.

### Research Interests
My research primarily focuses on how mesoscale eddies affect tracer distributions in the ocean and what is the mechanism of this effect. I use theory and idealized and comprehensive numerical models of ocean circulation to tackle these problems.

I am happy to discuss and collaborate with different minds!
