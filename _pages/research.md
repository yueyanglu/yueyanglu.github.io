My overall interests are in the ocean large-scale and mesoscale dynamics and their role in climate, using numerical simulations and a variety of advanced analytical methods. I have experience using numerical simulations for studies from dynamics and eddy-induced mixing to regional sea-level variations.

## Generalized eddy-induced advection: its role in dispersion and frontogenesis

The eddy-induced advection plays an important role in the generation of filaments and fronts and the enhancement of material dispersion and mixing.

Eddy-induced material dispersion represented by the generalized advection:
