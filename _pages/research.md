My overall interests are in the ocean large-scale and mesoscale dynamics and their role in climate, using numerical simulations and a variety of advanced analytical methods. I have experience using numerical simulations for studies from dynamics and eddy-induced mixing to regional sea-level variations.

## Generalized eddy-induced advection

The eddy-induced advection plays an important role in the generation of filaments and fronts and the enhancement of material dispersion and mixing.

 - Eddy-induced material dispersion is effectively represented by the generalized advection ([Lu et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-22-0108.1)):

- Mesoscale eddies sharpen the large-scale front by advecting (squeezing) tracer contours towards each other ([Lu and Kamenkovich, 2025](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024MS004693)):
